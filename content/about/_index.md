# About me

## Software Engineer
I have been working in the IT industry since 2015 as a **software engineer**. Throughout my career, I have had opportunities to work on projects involving various programming languages and technologies, as well as diverse software development areas such as: frontend, backend, game development, machine learning and cybersecurity. Despite the wide range of IT fields I have worked in, in recent years, I have been focusing on **backend** development, specifically with **Go**.

## Academic Research
I hold a **bachelor's** and **master's** degree in **Computer Science**. During my master's, I conducted research in Machine Learning, focusing on **Network Representation Learning (NRL)** (a.k.a. Graph Embedding) methods. I developed **RaDE** (Rank-Diffusion Embedding) and have published [two papers](/tags/publication).

## Blockchain
Recently, I became interested in **decentralized applications** and **blockchain** technology. I am especially interested in decentralized finance **(DeFi)** applications and **smart contract security**. I am also keen on smart contract development using **Solidity**; as well as core blockchain development using **Rust** or **Golang**. Currently, I'm working as an independent **Smart Contract Security Researcher**, participating in audit contests and seeking opportunities to transition my career from traditional software engineering to the web3 industry.
