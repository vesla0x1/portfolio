## Overview
I have completed the [sui-marketplace](https://overmind.xyz/quests/sui-marketplace) quest on Overmind.xyz. This quest involved implementing smart contract functions for users to buy and to sell items on a marketplace (i.e. `create_shop`, `add_item`, `unlist_item` and `purchase_item`) using the **[Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/)** language.

Even with no prior experience with **Move**, I managed to learn the basics and finish the quest just a few hours after it was released, passing all the unit tests and ranking 10 out of 64 competitors. I was **rewarded with $15 in SUI tokens** (see the [transfer transaction](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/F2nsk4bJiYC5N8Gq6oWzB1R9htp6suSjTYm32B6YnwmC)).
