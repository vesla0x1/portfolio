## Overview
This project aims to recreate (in)famous Ethereum transactions, similarly to [DeFi Hack Labs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs). However, it differs by not only recreating the transaction but also by providing a way to interact with vulnerable contracts. This allows to gain a better understanding of each step in the transaction's execution by creating logs and visualizing events in a flexible manner. In addition to this, another goal of this project is to provide a mechanism to modify vulnerable contracts, with the goal to mitigate the root cause of the issue and prevent hack to happen. Comprehensive write-ups of these hacks will also be included.
