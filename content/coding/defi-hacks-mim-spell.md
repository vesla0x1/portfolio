Here you should add references to the [article](/articles/mim-spell-attack) that you wrote and to the [branch](https://github.com/vesla0x1/defi-hacks/tree/master/mim-spell) that you have implemented the code.

Yep. You dont need to change anything to this works. The only thing that would be great to change is the URL. Can you have custom urls for a page? Maybe emulating a subsection?

Lets find out!

Yep! It just worked! You just needed to change the `path` attribute.

Hm...maybe slug is the way to go! Unfortunatelly, slug doesn't works as you expected.
