## Overview
[Sui Marketplace](https://overmind.xyz/quests/sui-marketplace) is one of the quests available on [Overmind.xyz](https://overmind.xyz). Overmind is an online platform that has the goal of serving an "on-chain resume" and incentivizing web3 learning by promoting competitive challenges (quests). In these challenges, developers should complete tasks, such as implementing smart contract functions and compete for a prize pool, generally in APTOS or SUI tokens. Top performers receive a share of this prize pool as a reward.

The goal of Sui Marketplace was to implement common marketplaces functions (i.e. `create_shop`, `add_item`, `unlist_item` and `purchase_item`) using the **[Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/)** language. This challenge was promoted by the [Sui Foundation](https://sui.io), and rewards were in SUI tokens.

## Solution
My solution is available on this **[pull request](https://github.com/vesla0x1/sui-marketplace/pull/1/files)**.

*NOTE: the original repository was private, so I have published my solution on this one*.

## My experience with Overmind
After I submitted my solution, it was not immediately evaluated. Instead, it was marked as 'pending.' I thought this was an issue with the CI/CD system, so I made [this tweet](https://twitter.com/vesla0xfa/status/1745911675012706751) asking about the status of my submission. They answered me almost immediately and informed me that solutions are manually evaluated - they do it this way to prevent plagiarism or fraud (e.g. the same person submits the same solution multiple times to make profits).

After four days, my solution was marked as "accepted". However I didn't received any SUI tokens. So, I [tweeted again](https://twitter.com/vesla0xfa/status/1747304274088865964) asking if this was right and they replied: _["Rewards will go out soon :)"](https://twitter.com/Adam_Tehc/status/1747304441609396442)_. Two days later, [they sent me](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/F2nsk4bJiYC5N8Gq6oWzB1R9htp6suSjTYm32B6YnwmC) **12.60504202 SUI tokens ($15.63)**. So, it took 7 days from the time I submitted my solution until I received the tokens in my wallet. While it didn't take excessively long, it could have been faster. Ne(O)vermind, I ended up making some money while learning something new, which is **awesome**!

## Achievement
Even with no prior experience with **Move**, I managed to learn the basics and finish the quest just a few hours after it was released. I was **rewarded with $15 in SUI tokens** (see the [transfer transaction](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/F2nsk4bJiYC5N8Gq6oWzB1R9htp6suSjTYm32B6YnwmC)) and ranked **10 out of 64** competitors.

## Conclusion
I had a great time learning Move while participating in this challenge. As a suggestion, they could automate the evaluation process of submissions and make payment processing faster, or at least create a better feedback system after submission.

Nevertheless, my overall experience with [Overmind.xyz](https://overmind.xyz) was extremely positive. They were very attentive, and I really appreciate the idea of an "on-chain resume", besides competing and potentially being rewarded while learning. I highly recommend the platform for anyone interested in trying and learning more about blockchain development. I assure you that you will have a great time learning.
