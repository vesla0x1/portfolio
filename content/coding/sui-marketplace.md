## Overview
[Sui Marketplace](https://overmind.xyz/quests/sui-marketplace) is one of the quests available on [Overmind.xyz](https://overmind.xyz). Overmind is an online platform that incentivises web3 learning by promoting competitive challenges (quests). On these challenges, developers should comple tasks (e.g. implement smart contract functions) and they compete for a prize pool (generally in tokens). Top performers are rewarded with a share of this prize pool.

The goal of this challenge was to implement common marketplaces functions (i.e. `create_shop`, `add_item`, `unlist_item` and `purchase_item`) using the **[Move](https://move-language.github.io/move/)** language.

## Solution
My solution is available on this **[pull request](https://github.com/vesla0x1/sui-marketplace/pull/1/files)** - *NOTE: the original repository was private, so I have published my solution on this one*.

## Achievement
Even with no prior experience with **Move**, I managed to learn the basics and finish the quest just a few hours after it was released. I was **rewarded with $15 in SUI tokens** (see the [transfer transaction](https://suiscan.xyz/mainnet/tx/F2nsk4bJiYC5N8Gq6oWzB1R9htp6suSjTYm32B6YnwmC)) and ranked **10 out of 64** competitors.
